  David Vardy (Director of the WKU Design Institute) and R. Spencer Steenblik (Asist. Dir. Public Architecture and Design Research Institute) have been leading an architecture studio focused on the complexities of aggregated collections of informal grass roots housing development. The studio has begun the process by looking at a "tiny house" competition sponsored by AIA Utah and commissioned by the Salt Lake City Mayor Mendenhall. The Students in the studio from all over China offer ideas and opportunities applicable in Salt Lake City, and Shanghai.
